    .SYNOPSIS
    This function generates two scripts, one that defines a function
    and another one that contains its tests.

    .DESCRIPTION
    This function generates two scripts, one that defines a function
    and another one that contains its tests. The files are by default
    placed in the current directory and are called and populated as such:

    The script defining the function: .\Clean.ps1:

    ```powershell
    function Clean {
        #Do something
        $true
    }
    ```

    The script containing the example test .\Clean.Tests.ps1:

    ```powershell
    BeforeAll {
        . $PSCommandPath.Replace('.Tests.ps1', '.ps1')
    }

    Describe "Clean" {

        It "Returns expected output" {
            Clean | Should -Be $true
        }
    }
    ```

    .PARAMETER Name
    Defines the name of the function and the name of the test to be created.

    .PARAMETER Path
    Defines path where the test and the function should be created, you can use full or relative path.
    If the parameter is not specified the scripts are created in the current directory.
