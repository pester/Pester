Describe 'Guarantee It fail on setup or teardown fail (running in clean runspace)' {
    #these tests are kinda tricky. We need to ensure few things:
    #1) failing BeforeEach will fail the test. This is easy, just put the BeforeEach in the same try catch as the invocation
    #   of It code.
    #2) failing AfterEach will fail the test. To do that we might put the AfterEach to the same try as the It code, BUT we also
    #   want to guarantee that the AfterEach will run even if the test in It will fail. For this reason the AfterEach must be triggered in
    #   a finally block. And there we are not protected by the catch clause. So we need another try in the the finally to catch teardown block
    #   error. If we fail to do that the state won't be correctly cleaned up and we can get strange errors like: "You are still in It block", when
    #   running next test. For the same reason I am putting the "ensure all tests run" tests here. otherwise you get false positives because you cannot determine
    #   if the suite failed because of the whole suite failed or just a single test failed.
