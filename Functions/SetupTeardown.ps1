.SYNOPSIS
    Defines a series of steps to perform at the beginning of every It block within
    the current Context or Describe block.

.DESCRIPTION
    BeforeEach, AfterEach, BeforeAll, and AfterAll are unique in that they apply
    to the entire Context or Describe block, regardless of the order of the
    statements in the Context or Describe.  For a full description of this
    behavior, as well as how multiple BeforeEach or AfterEach blocks interact
    with each other, please refer to the about_BeforeEach_AfterEach help file.
